## Hi there 👋, I'm Dawson, a Business Intelligence Analyst


Hey! I'm Dawson, a Business Intelligence Analyst with entry-level experience analyzing, cleaning, and visualizing data to support business decision-making. Throughout my learning journey, I have completed multiple end-to-end analytics projects that transform raw datasets into actionable insights through structured analysis and reporting. My technical skill set includes data analysis, data cleaning, reporting, dashboard development, and data visualization, with a strong focus on translating business questions into measurable insights. Beyond technical skills, I bring strong problem-solving, analytical thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am continuously expanding my experience by building real-world projects and strengthening my ability to deliver data-driven insights that create business value.

Earlier this year, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program, an intensive, project-based curriculum designed to be completed in approximately four months. The program focuses on building practical, job-ready skills through hands-on work with real-world datasets, emphasizing data cleaning, analysis, reporting, and visualization to support business decision-making.
Throughout the program, I progressed through the full analytics workflow—defining business questions, preparing and analyzing data, and communicating insights through clear reports and dashboards. This experience strengthened both my technical capabilities and my ability to think critically, manage time effectively, and present data-driven insights to diverse stakeholders.

I am excited to participate in an upcoming externship program, where I will have the opportunity to apply the skills I’ve built throughout my training. Over the course of my learning, I have gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, analysis, reporting, and visualization, and I am eager to demonstrate how I can turn complex datasets into actionable business insights.

Some facts about me:
- I love to cook, and would rather create something instead of ordering in or eating out.
- I love to game, especially with my girlfriend.
- I am a huge movie watcher.
- I love music. My favorite artist are Motley Crue and Pink Floyd.
- My goals for 2026: landing my dream job and getting a new car.
